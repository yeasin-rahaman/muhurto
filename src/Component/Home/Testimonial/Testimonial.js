            review: ' am very, very picky. I have talked to many excellent photographers and have explained our wedding marathon. Most photographers were not up to it, or at least not the way I liked it.  It was a great pleasure a privilege to have Muhurto to cover our wedding. I am very happy with my decision and not only would I hire them again for the wedding, but also for different future events that hopefully come up.‚Äù'
